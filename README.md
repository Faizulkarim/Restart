# Restart

## Overview
Restart is a demo iOS application built with SwiftUI to explore and implement various advanced SwiftUI features. This project showcases my understanding and practical application of state management, gestures, animations, and user feedback in iOS development.

## Features

- **Persistent Storage with @AppStorage:** Utilizes the @AppStorage property wrapper for seamless data storage and retrieval using UserDefaults.
- **Interactive Drag Gestures:** Implements drag gestures to dynamically update the UI based on user interactions.
- **Smooth Animations:** Integrates animations to enhance UI transitions and provide a more engaging user experience.
- **Horizontal Parallax Effect:** Creates a horizontal parallax effect using drag gestures, leveraging absolute values for smooth and responsive movement.
- **Rotation Effects:** Combines drag gestures with rotation effects to add depth and interactivity to UI components.
- **Auditory Feedback:** Adds sound effects during screen transitions to enrich the overall user experience.
- **Haptic Feedback:** Provides tactile responses through haptic feedback for both full and half-drag gestures, improving user interaction and realism.


## Learning Points:
By working on the Restart project, I have deepened my knowledge and skills in:

- Efficiently using @AppStorage to handle persistent data in SwiftUI applications.
- Implementing and handling drag gestures to create interactive UI elements.
- Incorporating animations to create smooth and visually appealing transitions.
- Developing a horizontal parallax effect for an immersive user experience.
- Applying rotation effects in conjunction with drag gestures for added interactivity.
- Enhancing the user experience with sound effects during transitions.
- Integrating haptic feedback to provide a tactile response for user actions.
