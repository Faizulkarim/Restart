# What I Learned from Creating This Project
## Using @AppStorage in SwiftUI:

Leveraged the @AppStorage property wrapper, which utilizes UserDefaults to store and retrieve persistent data effortlessly. This feature enabled seamless data storage and access across app sessions.
## Adding Drag Gestures:

Implemented drag gestures to enhance user interaction, updating the UI dynamically based on drag movements.
## Incorporating Animations:

Integrated animations to improve UI transitions, making the user experience more engaging and visually appealing.
## Creating a Horizontal Parallax Effect:

Developed a horizontal parallax effect using drag gestures. This involved utilizing absolute values to achieve a smooth and responsive parallax movement.
## Applying Rotation Effects:

Combined drag gestures with rotation effects to add a layer of depth and interactivity to the UI components.
## Using Sounds for Screen Transitions:

Added auditory feedback by incorporating sounds during screen transitions, enhancing the overall user experience.
## Implementing Haptic Feedback:

Integrated haptic feedback to provide tactile responses for both full and half drag gestures, adding a sense of realism and responsiveness to user interactions.
